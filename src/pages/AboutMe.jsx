        <p> Hello! My name is Renard, but most people just call me Ren. 
            Welcome to my website! A few thing about myself. I'm a guy in his 
            mid-twenties who loves drawing and animation, mostly drawing these 
            days due to lack of time to animate. I graduated UCF in 2022 with a
            bachlor degree in experimental animation, basically a fusion between 
            illustration and film media. It includes everything from traditional
            painting to video game development. 
            <p>Here, I've compiled portfolio as well as links to my social media. </p>
